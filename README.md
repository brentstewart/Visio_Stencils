# Visio_Stencils

This repository contains Visio Stencils and was described in https://www.nextpertise.net/visio_shapes/.  

"Brent's Stencils" is a more traditional set of icons with some work put in to customize connection points.  The link lines have been modified to set the text angle to ATAN(Height/Width) which will cause text to angle with the line.

"Affinity Blue" comes from the alternate icons used in GNS3.  I really like the clean look.  Visio drawings can get overly complex, and this set let's you focus on the types of devices and connections.
